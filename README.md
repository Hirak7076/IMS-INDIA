IMS-INDIA Automation Assignment
Hi,
     My name is Hirak Goswami, I have used Cypress for automating the given website for checking the Base price is matching with Expected price or not. Cypress executes the script for 7 cities and centers for matching the base price and expected price in the excel sheet. The reports can be generated by entering “npm run test“  ”npm run report” command and the Automation can be run by “npx cypress run” command in the terminal.

Observations -

Base Fees Change Dynamically -  When you select a different center from the dropdown, the Base Fees field updates automatically based on the selected location. This dynamic update works smoothly.


No Label or Tooltip for Fee Explanation -  The Base Fees amount appears, but there is no explanation or tooltip to clarify what it includes.


No Confirmation of Fee Accuracy -  There is no visual confirmation that the displayed fee is correct or final—it just updates silently.


Lack of Comparison Option -  Users cannot verify or compare Base Fees for different centers side by side. They must manually change and check one at a time.


Fee Display is Not Highlighted -  The Base Fees value appears in plain text; it’s not bold or visually distinct, which may cause users to miss it.
